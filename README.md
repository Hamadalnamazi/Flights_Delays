### 2. Data: 

**- Flight delays data:** http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

**- Airports statistics:** http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/previous_years/

### 3. Strategy:

1. Airports analysis: run statistical analysis and cluster similar aiports together

2. Flights analysis: run statistics and cluster similar flights together

3. Delays analysis: build predictive model

### 4. Application:
Build a front-end of a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and D3JS
